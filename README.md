Autumn
======

Autumn in it's currennt form is an <b>extremely</b> flexible grid system. However, it is hoped Autumn will eventually
evolve into an extensive framework that will enable you to take your projects from the sketching stages right through
to shipping the final product.

</ul>

The Syntax
==========
The syntax is effortless, there are no presentational classes (except the row class, 
which you can easily attach to a HTML5 ```<section>``` tag). Other than this you will
choose your class names.

 ```
    <section class="row">
        <article class="blog">
            Content here
        </article>
       
        <aside class="sidebar">
            Content here
        </aside>
    </section>
 ```
 
It's literally down to you to make your class names more semantic and meaningful.
