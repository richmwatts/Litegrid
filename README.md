Autumn
======

Autumn in it's currennt form is an <b>extremely</b> flexible grid system. However, it is hoped Autumn will eventually
evolve into an extensive framework that will enable you to take your projects from the sketching stages right through
to shipping the final product.

Prerequisites
=============

<ul>
<li>Ruby - Great guide for installing Ruby on MacOSX http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-install-ruby-on-a-mac/</li>
<li>SASS http://sass-lang.com/</li>
<li>The ability to copy simple commands into the terminal</li>
</ul>


Why Choose Autumn?
==================

<ul>
<li>It's extremely customizable</li>
<li>It contains two grid systems</li>
<li>Easily nest and offset your grid</li>
<li>It's semantic</li>
<li>Superb browser support </li>
<li>It's lighting quick to use</li>
<li>Built using the preprocessor SCSS</li>
<li>Extensive documentation & support</li>
<li>It's not BootStrap</li>
</ul>

The Syntax
==========
The syntax is effortless, there are no presentational classes (except the row class, 
which you can easily attach to a HTML5 ```<section>``` tag). Other than this you will
choose your class names.

 ```
    <section class="row">
        <article class="blog">
            Content here
        </article>
       
        <aside class="sidebar">
            Content here
        </aside>
    </section>
 ```

It's literally down to you to make your class names more semantic and meaningful.

Getting Started
===============

I've released a screencast showcasing the Autumn grid in action here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkdhIdg1U60

There is also quick references guides for you to refer to inside the style.scss & grid.scss files.

NOTE: In the above video I forgot to showcase the grid's offset capabilities so I plan on uploading
another video in the coming days.
 
 
Browser Support
===============

Autumn's grid has amazing cross browser support.

<ul>
<li>IE 8 +</li>
<li>Firefox 3 +</li>
<li>Chrome ALL</li>
<li>Safari 4 +</li>
<li>*Opera 10 +</li>
</ul>

*Autumn's grid is supported all the way down to Opera 10 but users may experience
some minor subpixel rendering differences in older versions of Opera.
